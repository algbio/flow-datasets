If you use this dataset, please cite the above publication.

Contents:
- `*.fasta(.gz)`: Genome FASTA files.
- `nanosim.abundances.tsv`: Tab-separated file (filename TAB abundance). Abundances are scaled Ã—10 and rounded inside the pipeline (see `datasets.py`, dataset key `complex32`).

Notes:
- Filenames in column 1 must match the FASTA files (optionally with `.gz` extension) for successful loading.
